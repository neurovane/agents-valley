## 📊 Database Schema Updates Needed

Apply the complete schema file:
```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: supabase-schema-complete.sql

-- Key additions:
-- 1. Complete RLS policies for all tables
-- 2. CHECK constraints for data validation
-- 3. Performance indexes for common queries
-- 4. Triggers for auto-updates
-- 5. MCP-related tables and policies
```

### Critical Schema Changes
```sql
-- Add CHECK constraints
ALTER TABLE agents ADD CONSTRAINT check_name_length 
  CHECK (length(name) >= 3 AND length(name) <= 100);

ALTER TABLE agents ADD CONSTRAINT check_description_length 
  CHECK (length(description) >= 10 AND length(description) <= 2000);

-- Add performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_agents_publisher_id ON agents(publisher_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_agents_category ON agents(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_agents_upvotes_count ON agents(upvotes_count DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_agents_tags ON agents USING GIN(tags);

-- Apply same for mcp_servers and events
-- See supabase-schema-complete.sql for full details
```

✅ Email validation
✅ Username format validation
✅ JWT-based authentication via Supabase

### Authorization

✅ Owner-only modifications
✅ Public read, authenticated write
✅ No privilege escalation possible

### Input Security
✅ All inputs validated with Zod
✅ All inputs sanitized
✅ XSS prevention via DOMPurify
✅ SQL injection prevention
✅ URL protocol validation
✅ File name sanitization

### API Security
✅ Rate limiting on all endpoints
✅ CORS configured via Supabase
✅ HTTPS enforced (via Vercel/hosting)
✅ No exposed secrets

### Database Security
✅ Row Level Security enabled
✅ CASCADE deletes configured
✅ CHECK constraints for data integrity
✅ UNIQUE constraints prevent duplicates
✅ Foreign key relationships enforced

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Caching
- React Query caching (2-10 minutes)
- Browser caching for static assets
- Stale-while-revalidate strategy

### Database
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- GIN indexes for array/tag searches
- Optimized query patterns

### Code Splitting
- Next.js automatic code splitting
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Route-based splitting

## 🐛 Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

The following ESLint warnings exist but don't affect functionality:

1. **Unused variables** - Some variables kept for future use
2. **Missing dependencies** - Intentionally excluded to prevent re-renders
3. **`<img>` tags** - Will be replaced with Next.js `<Image>` in Priority 4

These will be addressed in future updates.
